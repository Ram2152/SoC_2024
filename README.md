# Summer of Code 2024
Welcome to the SoC I did as a mentee in my Summer.  
__Topic:__ Conquering Competitive Programming  
__Mentors:__ Saksham Rathi, Anirudh Garg and Utkarsh Pant  
This was a Starter course for anyone who wants to start their Competitive Programming journey. The plan devised by my mentors was perfect and had enough time to cover the all required concepts with good amount of practice. I would encourage anyone who wants to start their CP journey to follow the plan and learn the basics.  
I have added the Plan and Resources required for completing the SoC. You can check them out in this Repo.
## Resources
__NOTE:__ It is not required to learn everything from all the following books, rather follow the plan and study particular concepts from it's best available resource.  
You can find all the following mentioned textbooks [Here](./Resources).  
The following were textbooks for reference:
- Competitive Programmer's Handbook
- Guide to Competitive Programming
- Introduction to Algorithms
- Algorithm Design (J. Kleinberg, E. Tardos)
- Steven-Halim Felix-Halim Competitive-Programming-3 The-New-Lower-Bound-of-Programming-Contests-Lulu.com 2013  
- SkienaTheAlgorithmDesignManual
- Looking-for-a-challenge-2
- b2-programming_challenges 
 
__VERY IMPORTANT AGAIN__: It is not needed to learn everything from all the books mentioned above. It is best to follow the Plan devised.

## Plan
The plan I followed during my SoC can be found [Here](https://github.com/Ram2152/SoC_2024/blob/main/Plan.md).

## Conclusion
Overall, this is a great course/study plan for someone who has no idea what Competitive Programming is (Yea, that was me before taking this courseðŸ˜‰).
I would like to thank my mentors for choosing me as a mentee and giving me this wonderful opportunity to learn CP.
